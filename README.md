# Parkinsons-detector
In this repository, I've implemented a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model in Jupyter Notebook to analyze a curated dataset for early detection of Parkinson's disease. 
Machine Learning Model: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Dataset: Predefined dataset containing essential features related to Parkinson's disease.
Tools Used: Jupyter Notebook, Python (libraries including scikit-learn,pandas,numpy)
Achievements: Achieved high accuracy in predicting Parkinson's disease, highlighting the potential of ML in healthcare.
